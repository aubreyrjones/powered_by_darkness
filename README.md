This is not a standalone game. It includes no lore, setting, or
history. It contains only brief and dry descriptions of powers, and no
coherent description of vampiric existence. Additionally, it is
incomplete, as it includes only the powers we've used in our game so
far. These are essentially just very intricate character sheets.

To play this game you need a copy of Vampire: the Masquerade, 20th
Anniversary Edition. You can find that
[here](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/94815/Vampire-The-Masquerade-20th-Anniversary-Edition). You
also probably should get a copy of Apocalypse World and read that for
the general philosophy of this style of RPG.

This work is based on the Powered by the Dark hack of Apocalypse
World. You can find it
[here](https://holdenshearer.wordpress.com/powered-by-the-dark/). However
I've rewritten nearly every move to clarify and tighten the wording
and to change the tone of especially 7-9 results. I also significantly
changed several mechanics, including Final Death, losing/restoring
loss of Path/Humanity, diablerie, and others. It's basically a hack of
the hack at this point. :)

To use these playbooks, print out a character sheet for each player
character. Additionally print one copy of `vampire_cheat.pdf` for each
PC, which contains the moves available to all PCs. Print the
appropriate page from `paths_cheat.pdf` for their path of enlightment
(including Humanity). And finally print their Clan Discplines
sheet(s).
